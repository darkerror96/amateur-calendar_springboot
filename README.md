# amateur-calendar_springboot

Novice version of Calendar Generator as a Java Web application using SpringBoot.

For all beginners, this is perfect repository to start-off with a spring-boot application that generates Calendar of user specified year in simple manner. I have used Thymeleaf as a template engine.

I have used Eclipse 4.9.0 as an IDE.

For testing the application, user needs to input specific year and calendar for the specified year is generated. It also shows Federal Holidays seperately.
